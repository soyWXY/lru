This is a implement of lru and a test for it. It is a [homework](https://hackmd.io/@sysprog/linux2022-quiz1#%E6%B8%AC%E9%A9%97-3) of linux kernel course in NCKU.

lru.c, lru.h, list.h are the files for implementation of lru. Others relate to test. Here, I use googletest to test c/cpp. Get a glimpse at 
[google document](https://google.github.io/googletest/primer.html) for it.

To build test and run the test

    $make
    $./lro_test.o
